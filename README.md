## Kye

This is an implementation of the 1992 game Kye by Colin Phipps.

It is built using the [Potato Engine](https://github.com/conartist6/potato-engine).

This is the reference implementation game for the Potato Engine.

### Initial Setup

If you just want to get started tinkering with some code that already works, this is the right place to get started. You should click the handy-dandy clone button on this project's [Github page](https://github.com/conartist6/potato-engine) (if you're not already there). Once you've done that, I recommmend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (particularly if you're not already familiar with git) to check out a copy of the repository you've just forked.

You will need to install `node` and `yarn`. Once you have done this, open a terminal and run

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Note that this setup is the same as the setup for any create-react-app app.
